# 💼 Midnight Developers Palindrome Checker

## 📖 Overview
Created as part of my FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification. This project is a fully responsive palindrome checker built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Designed under my developer alias Midnight Developer, this project demonstrates functional logic with a visually distinctive, accessible layout. Users can enter a word or phrase to instantly check whether it qualifies as a palindrome, with results displayed dynamically on the page.

The application features a clear header and subtitle, an interactive input and validation system, an educational explanation of palindromes, and a styled footer. All wrapped in a clean, responsive design that adapts smoothly across screen sizes.
